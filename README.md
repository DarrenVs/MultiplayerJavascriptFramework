# MultiplayerJavascriptFramework
Multiplayer framework with multible rooms and on-server object management

Client can be found in MultiplayerJavascriptFramework/JavascriptFramework2.0/.
The server and client are all written by me. However the Node.js modules I used (like express or socket.io) I did not write.

# NOTE:
This is a Online-Multiplayer JavaScript Canvas Framework..(or something with a cool name). Open the game in two browsertabs next to eachother to see the framework in action! (if you have no friends to play with)

Sorry for the mess.. I don't get much time on these 'small projects' so I try to get as much done as possible in trade for some tidyness and comments.


# Server down or you feel like hosting your own server?
1. Install Node.js
2. Required libraries for 'server.js'
 - Express
 - Socket.io
3. Start 'server.js' with Node.js
4. Go to "http://localhost:80/" in a (chrome based) web browser
